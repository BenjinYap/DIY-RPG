# DIY-RPG

A text game engine designed to be able to run any game provided in an XML format. Originally developed to run a text based version of Pokemon that I would create but eventually expanded to support any game.

The final project I did for my Grade 12 CS course. I continued working on it into the summer after Grade 12 then I stopped. I have no idea the state in which I left the project because it's been too long.
